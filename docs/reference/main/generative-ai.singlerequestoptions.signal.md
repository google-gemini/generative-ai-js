An object that may be used to abort asynchronous requests. The request may also be aborted due to the expiration of the timeout value, if provided.

NOTE: AbortSignal is a client-only operation. Using it to cancel an operation will not cancel the request in the service. You will still be charged usage for any applicable operations.

```typescript
signal?: AbortSignal;
```
